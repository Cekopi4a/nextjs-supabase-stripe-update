# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Free Exercise Database Setup Instructions

## Current Status
‚úÖ All code integration completed  
‚úÖ API endpoints created  
‚úÖ React components ready  
‚è≥ **Database table needs to be created**

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create the Database Table
1. Open your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/umxmcnfurnnvaurutoho
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `create-exercises-table.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

### Step 2: Import the Exercises
```bash
# Run this command in your terminal
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/exercises/import" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

### Step 3: Verify the Integration
1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev` 
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/protected/clients/[clientId]/calendar
3. Click on any calendar day to edit workout
4. The new exercise selector should appear with 800+ exercises

## Expected Results

After running the setup:
- ‚úÖ **873 exercises** imported from free-exercise-db
- ‚úÖ **Full-text search** working across exercise names
- ‚úÖ **Advanced filters** by level, category, equipment, muscles
- ‚úÖ **High-quality images** for all exercises
- ‚úÖ **Detailed instructions** for each exercise
- ‚úÖ **Mobile-responsive** exercise selection interface

## Verification Commands

Check if exercises imported successfully:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/exercises/search?limit=5"
```

Search for specific exercises:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/exercises/search?search=push&level=beginner"
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Table does not exist" error:**
- Make sure you ran the SQL from `create-exercises-table.sql` in Supabase dashboard

**"Unauthorized" error:**
- This is normal in production; the import works fine in development mode

**Import fails:**
- Check that your Supabase keys are correct in `.env.local`
- Verify internet connection (imports from GitHub)
